## Sequential Minimal Optimization: A Fast Algorithm for Training Support Vector Machines

This is an cpp-implementation of sequential-minimal-optimization to solve support-vector machine.  

The implementation of solover is based on original paper below.

Therefore it is using huristic way of optimization, the solover is rapidly converged.
